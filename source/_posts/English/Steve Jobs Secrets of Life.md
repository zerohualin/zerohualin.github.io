# Steve Jobs Secrets of Life

so the thing i would say is ,

when you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is

and your your life is just to live your life inside the world

try not to bash into the walls too much

try to have a nice family life , have fun ,save a little money

but life that's a very limited life 

life can be  much broader

once you discover one simple fact

and that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people they were not smart than you

and you can change it 

you can influence it

you can build your own things that other people can use

and the minute that you understand that you can poke life 

and actually something will you know if you push in something will pop out the other side

that you can you can change it you can mold it

um that's maybe the most important thing is to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there 

and you're just gonna live in it versus embrace it change it improve it make your mark upon it

i think that's very important and however you learn that once you learn it.

you will want to change life and make it better because it's kind of messed up in a lot of ways.

once you learn that you'll never be the same agin.
